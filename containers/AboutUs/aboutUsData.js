                "Deep learning's recent history has been one of achievement:\
                from triumphing over humans in the game of Go to world-leading \
                performance in image recognition, voice recognition, translation, \
                and other tasks. But this progress has come with a voracious appetite for computing power. \
                This article reports on the computational demands of Deep Learning applications in five \
                prominent application areas and shows that progress in all five is strongly reliant on \
                increases in computing power. Extrapolating forward this reliance reveals that progress \
                along current lines is rapidly becoming economically, technically, and environmentally \
                unsustainable. Thus, continued progress in these applications will require dramatically \
                more computationally-efficient methods, which will either have to come from changes to \
                deep learning or from moving to other machine learning methods.",
